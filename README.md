# Midterm Project - Ironhack Front-End Web Development Bootcamp
This project is about building a responsive website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript based on a design provided in a Figma file, and then deploying it to Netlify using Git.

It consists of three pages: home, project and contact. The project page and the contact page have a JavaScript functionality. The project page receives information from an API, while the contact page has a form validation.
